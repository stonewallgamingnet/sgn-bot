## Notes

When you start `pm2` be sure to include the ecosystem.config.js file like this:

```
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

This is how the enviroment variables are set on the server and without them the script won't load the correct 
config file. You may need to run the command from `~/.pm2` where the file is located.

## Errors

You can check the pm2 logs with the following command:

```
pm2 logs
```

Log files are located in `~/.pm2/logs`.

## Enviroment Variables

To change enviroment variables on Windows you can do:

```
set NODE_ENV=production
```

To unset:

```
set NODE_ENV=
```
